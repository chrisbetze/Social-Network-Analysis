## Network Types
* Regular (Lattice) Networks
* Random Graphs (Gilbert Model)
* Random Graphs (Erdos-Renyi Model)
* Random Regular Graphs
* Random Geometric Graphs
* Small-world Networks
* Scale-free (Exponential) Networks

## Analysis and Study

### Generation - Visualization
We generate, analyze and visualize the above topologies, using `networkx` and `matplotlib` library.

### Degree Analysis
* Degree Distribution
* Cumulative Degree Distribution

### Strength Analysis
* Weighted Graphs
* Cumulative Strength Distribution

### Path Length Analysis
* Average Path Length

### Clustering Coefficient (CC) Analysis
* Detailed calculation of CC
* Cumulative CC Distribution
* Average Clustering Coefficient

### Centrality Analysis
* Degree Centrality
* Closeness centrality
* Betweenness centrality
* Eigenvector centrality
* Ego-betweenness centrality

### Connectivity Analysis
* Percentage of connectivity, based on certain parameters for each topology
* Threshold Behavior

### Evolutionary Growth
We study the evolutionary character of Watts-Strogatz model (Regular to Small-world and finally to Random).
